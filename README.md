# mRNA_sequence_reader
Fun little terminal app that takes any viable mature mRNA sequence and returns the location of the start &amp; stop codons, along with the specific protein codons in between.

Example mRNA sequences:

#1 AUCCGAACAUGAAAAGAGCAAUAUUCAACUAAGCUACC

#2 ACUUCGGACAUGAAUCCGCAGGCAUGACCGACU

#3 GGGCAUGAUCGUUGCCGAUGAAGGAAGACUCCCCCAUCAACGGUGGUAAAAUG
